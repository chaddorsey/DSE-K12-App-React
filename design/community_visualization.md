# Community Connections & Visualization Design

## Problem Statement
Create an engaging system for:
1. Discovering and managing connections with other conference attendees
2. Visualizing community data in an interactive, animated way
3. Supporting both private exploration and shared social experiences

## Core Features

### 1. Connection Discovery ("Know" Tab)
- Avatar Grid View
  - Dynamic search filtering
  - Smooth avatar transitions
  - Recognition levels (face, name, talked to, know well)
- Quiz Modes
  - Picture-to-name matching
  - Name-to-face matching
  - Progressive difficulty

### 2. Data Visualization ("Graph" Tab)
- Interactive Plot Types
  - Dot plots (univariate)
  - Scatterplots (bivariate)
  - Histograms (categorical)
  - Stacked bar charts
- Dynamic Transitions
  - Smooth dot movement
  - Fade in/out for filtering
  - Morphing between chart types
- Variable Selection
  - Axis controls
  - Legend/color mapping
  - Auto-scaling

## Technical Architecture

### Components
```typescript
interface GraphState {
  plotType: 'scatter' | 'histogram' | 'dotplot';
  xAxis: Variable;
  yAxis?: Variable;
  colorBy?: Variable;
  filters: Filter[];
  animations: AnimationConfig;
}

interface ConnectionState {
  recognitionLevels: {
    faceKnown: string[];
    nameKnown: string[];
    talkedTo: string[];
    knowWell: string[];
  };
  quizProgress: QuizProgress;
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User Profile Data -> Connection System
2. Response Data -> Visualization System
3. Interaction Events -> Animation System

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Connection System
1. Avatar grid with basic filtering
2. Recognition level tracking
3. Simple quiz implementation

### Phase 2: Basic Visualization
1. Dot plot and scatter plot
2. Variable selection controls
3. Basic transitions

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Complex chart types
2. Advanced animations
3. Social sharing features

## Success Metrics
1. User engagement with connections
2. Time spent exploring visualizations
3. Number of shared insights
4. Quiz completion rates
