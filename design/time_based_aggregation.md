# Time-Based Response Aggregation System

## Overview
System for aggregating response data across different time windows to support efficient querying and analysis.

## Goals
- Aggregate response metrics across multiple time windows (hourly, daily, weekly)
- Support efficient statistical analysis
- Enable real-time updates while maintaining performance
- Minimize storage costs through smart data retention

## Architecture

### Time Windows
- Hourly: Last 24 hours
- Daily: Last 30 days
- Weekly: Last 52 weeks
- Monthly: Last 12 months

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface TimeWindowMetrics {
  windowStart: Timestamp;
  windowEnd: Timestamp;
  metrics: {
    responseCount: number;
    averageAccuracy: number;
    averageConfidence: number;
    distribution: {
      [key: string]: number;  // For multiple choice
      coordinates?: {         // For XY questions
        clusters: Array<{x: number, y: number, count: number}>
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Components
1. AggregationService
   - Manages aggregation windows
   - Handles real-time updates
   - Maintains cache

2. TimeWindowManager
   - Creates and updates time windows
   - Handles window transitions
   - Manages data retention

3. StatisticalAnalyzer
   - Calculates statistical measures
   - Identifies trends and patterns
   - Generates insights

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Aggregation
1. [ ] Implement TimeWindowManager
2. [ ] Create base AggregationService
3. [ ] Add real-time update support
4. [ ] Add tests

### Phase 2: Statistical Analysis
1. [ ] Implement StatisticalAnalyzer
2. [ ] Add trend detection
3. [ ] Add correlation analysis
4. [ ] Add tests

### Phase 3: Caching & Optimization
1. [ ] Add caching layer
2. [ ] Implement data pruning
3. [ ] Add performance monitoring
4. [ ] Add tests

## Questions to Resolve
1. How to handle timezone differences?
2. What's the optimal storage strategy for different time windows?
3. How to handle missing data points?
4. What's the cache invalidation strategy?

## Security Considerations
- Access control for aggregated data
- Rate limiting for real-time updates
- Data privacy in aggregated metrics
