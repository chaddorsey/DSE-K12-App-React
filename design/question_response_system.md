# Question & Response System Design

## Overview
Design for storing and managing questions, responses, and associated metrics for the DSE K12 Connections app.

## Goals
- Store and manage questions and user responses efficiently
- Track user interactions and guesses about others' responses
- Support real-time metrics and leaderboards
- Enable visualization data queries
- Maintain performance with ~100K responses

## Current Status
- ✅ Basic response submission
- ✅ Response validation
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ✅ Error handling

## Core Components

### 1. Data Layer
- Response Storage (Firestore)
  - `/responses/{responseId}` - Individual responses
  - `/response_metrics/{questionId}` - Aggregated metrics

### 2. Validation Layer
- Client-side validation
- Server-side validation (Firestore Rules)
- Error reporting and handling

### 3. Service Layer
- Response submission
- Batch operations
- Metrics updates

## Implementation Status

### Completed
1. Core Question Types
   - Multiple choice questions
   - XY coordinate questions with quadrant/polar modes
   - Coordinate transformation system
   - Touch and accessibility support

2. Question Components
   - Basic question rendering
   - Interactive response collection
   - Coordinate normalization and validation
   - Response validation

### In Progress
1. Response System
   - Response storage
   - Real-time updates
   - Metrics calculation
   - Visualization components

2. Multi-dimensional Questions
   - Grid-based questions
   - Question pairing system
   - Response correlation

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Response Batching & Performance
1. Implement batch response submission
   - Handle offline submissions
   - Queue and retry mechanism
   - Conflict resolution

2. Optimize Firestore usage
   - Index optimization
   - Query patterns
   - Caching strategy

3. Performance monitoring
   - Response submission timing
   - Error rates
   - Batch operation success rates

### Priority 2: Data Integrity
1. Implement data consistency checks
2. Add data recovery mechanisms
3. Set up monitoring alerts

### Priority 3: Analytics & Visualization
1. Real-time response tracking
2. Response pattern analysis
3. User interaction metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Response Batching (Current Focus)
1. [ ] Create BatchProcessor service
2. [ ] Implement offline storage
3. [ ] Add retry mechanism
4. [ ] Add conflict resolution
5. [ ] Add performance monitoring

### Phase 2: Data Integrity
1. [ ] Implement consistency checks
2. [ ] Set up monitoring
3. [ ] Create recovery tools

### Phase 3: Analytics
1. [ ] Implement real-time tracking
2. [ ] Add pattern analysis
3. [ ] Create visualization components

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we implement soft deletion for questions?
2. How long should we retain match history?
3. Do we need to implement rate limiting for guesses?
4. Should visualization configs be versioned?

## New Collection for Multi-dimensional Questions
```typescript
interface MultiDimensionalQuestion {
  id: string;
  constituentQuestions: [string, string]; // IDs of constituent questions
  type: 'grid';  // Future-proofing for other types
  metadata: {
    isPrefered: boolean;  // Indicates if this is a pre-determined good pairing
    title?: string;
    description?: string;
  };
}
```
