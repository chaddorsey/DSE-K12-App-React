# Refactoring & Optimization for Robust Project Architecture – Design Document

## Current Context
- **Overview:**  
  The existing codebase is a basic React/Express application used for a quiz/match system. The frontend (React) handles user login, onboarding, and interactive quiz/match flows (including head-to-head matches), while the backend (Express) provides RESTful API endpoints for user management, authentication, match sessions, and distractor generation.
- **Key Components and Relationships:**  
  - **Frontend:**  
    - A monolithic `App.js` containing components for Login, Register, ResetPassword, Onboarding, People, SubjectDetail, HeadToHead components, and QuizSession.
    - API utilities in `src/api.js` for communication with the backend.
  - **Backend:**  
    - An Express server (`backend/server.js`) exposing endpoints.
    - In‑memory user storage and models in `backend/models/User.js`.
- **Pain Points / Gaps Being Addressed:**  
  - Inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., remnants of "Hood" vs. "HeadToHead") and mixed style conventions.
  - Poor separation between implementation details and interfaces, making the code harder to maintain and extend.
  - A monolithic file structure that hinders IDE navigation and large-scale refactoring.
  - Limited structured logging and error handling, making troubleshooting more difficult.
  - Public interfaces (both API and UI) are not clearly defined, documented, or designed for easy use.
- **Network Environment Context:**
  - Application will be used in hotel/conference settings with restricted/gated WiFi
  - Users may experience portal redirects and intermittent connectivity
  - Network bandwidth and latency may be variable

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Consistency & Readability:**  
  All code must adhere to a consistent naming convention and style that reflects the Coding Style Guide.
- **Clear Interfaces:**  
  Both API and component interfaces should be minimal, intuitive, and easy to use correctly while preventing misuse.
- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  Distinct modules for UI components, API communication, and backend logic to improve maintainability.
- **Robust Error Handling and Logging:**  
  Provide actionable error messages and structured logging to support debugging.
- **Modularity for IDE Use:**  
  Prepare the codebase for splitting into separate modules/files to facilitate extensive work in external IDEs.

### Network Requirements
- **Portal Handling:**
  Must gracefully handle WiFi portal redirects without breaking application flow
- **Session Management:**
  Must maintain user sessions across network interruptions
- **Performance:**
  - Initial page load within 5 seconds on 3G connections
  - API payloads under 50KB per request
  - Total initial bundle under 500KB compressed
- **User Feedback:**
  Clear, user-friendly connection status indicators

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:**
  - Meet specific network performance targets for hotel/conference environments
  - Maintain response times within defined thresholds
- **Code Quality:**
  - Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per function
  - Maximum file size of 300 lines
  - Maximum function size of 30 lines
- **Test Coverage:**
  80%+ coverage for business logic
- **Documentation:**
  100% coverage for public APIs and React components
- **Scalability:**  
  The design should support easy extension and maintenance over time.
- **Observability:**  
  Integrate structured logging and metrics to monitor key events and errors.
- **Security:**  
  Follow secure coding practices for authentication, data validation, and error handling.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Consistent Naming and Style
- **Approach:**  
  Enforce a naming standard (e.g., always use "HeadToHead" instead of variants) and update all code to use semantic, descriptive names.
- **Rationale:**  
  Consistent naming simplifies code reviews and reduces confusion.

### 2. Separation of Implementation from Interface
- **Approach:**  
  Split the code into clear modules: separate UI components (each in its own file), API utilities, and backend models.
- **Rationale:**  
  This improves maintainability, eases testing, and reduces accidental coupling between layers.

### 3. Modularization for IDE-Friendliness
- **Approach:**  
  Although the current demo is in a single file, plan to modularize components into separate files to improve navigation and support extensive refactoring.
- **Rationale:**  
  A modular structure increases developer productivity and clarity when working in an external IDE.

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Error Handling
- **Approach:**  
  Integrate structured logging, clear error messages, and robust testing (both unit and integration tests) into the codebase.
- **Rationale:**  
  Good observability reduces support overhead and aids in rapid troubleshooting.

### 5. Minimal, Well-Documented Interfaces
- **Approach:**  
  Redesign public interfaces to expose only what is necessary; document functions and components with clear comments and examples.
- **Rationale:**  
  Clear interfaces lower the barrier for new developers and reduce the likelihood of errors.

### 6. Network Resilience Design
- **Approach:**
  Implement basic connection handling and status feedback without complex offline capabilities
- **Rationale:**
  Balance network resilience needs with maintenance simplicity

## Technical Design

### 1. Core Components
- **Frontend:**  
  - React components for authentication, onboarding, quiz/match flows, and head-to-head interactions.
  - API client module (`src/api.js`) for handling network requests.
- **Backend:**  
  - Express server (`backend/server.js`) exposing RESTful endpoints.
  - In‑memory data models (`backend/models/User.js`), with plans for future migration to persistent storage.
- **Data Contracts:**  
  Consistent JSON payloads for API requests and responses, following our naming and structure guidelines.
- **Network Handling:**
  - Status monitoring and user feedback system
  - Portal redirect handling
  - Basic retry logic for failed requests

### 2. Data Models
- **User Model:**  
  Contains fields such as id, username, email, hashed password, and onboardingAnswers.
- **Session Model:**  
  Represents a head-to-head match with fields such as sessionId, initiator, opponent, status, and results.
- **API Data Contracts:**  
  Clearly defined payload structures for both requests and responses.

### 3. Integration Points
- **Frontend-Backend Communication:**  
  RESTful API endpoints with appropriate error handling and structured logging.
- **Authentication:**  
  JWT-based authentication with secure token handling and authorization headers.
