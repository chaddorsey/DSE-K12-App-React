# Code Audit Design

## Objective
Identify and fix inconsistencies in the codebase to improve maintainability and reliability.

## Areas of Focus

### 1. Naming Conventions
- Component naming (PascalCase)
- File naming consistency
- Variable/function naming patterns
- Type/Interface naming

### 2. File Organization
- Directory structure
- File location conventions
- Import/export patterns
- Module boundaries

### 3. Code Style
- TypeScript usage
- Error handling patterns
- Async/await usage
- Comment style and documentation

### 4. Testing Patterns
- Test file organization
- Mock usage patterns
- Test naming conventions
- Coverage patterns

## Audit Process
1. Automated analysis using ESLint/TypeScript
2. Manual review of key patterns
3. Document findings
4. Propose fixes
5. Implement changes in phases

## Success Criteria
- Consistent naming across codebase
- Clear file organization
- Standardized code patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage
