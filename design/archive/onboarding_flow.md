# Onboarding Flow Design

## Overview
The onboarding process needs to be engaging while gathering essential user data for social connections and future quiz content.

## User Journey Requirements

### 1. Initial Profile Setup
- Basic info collection (name, role, interests)
- Profile picture/avatar upload
- Quick, engaging form with progress indication

### 2. Interest Mapping
- Conference-specific interests
- Research/teaching areas
- Professional background
- Personal interests for social matching

### 3. Connection Priming
- Initial connection identification
- Basic social network mapping
- Conference-specific relationships

## Technical Design

### Components
```typescript
interface OnboardingFlow {
  // Track overall progress
  progress: {
    currentStep: number;
    totalSteps: number;
    canProceed: boolean;
  };

  // Question management
  questions: {
    current: Question;
    answered: Answer[];
    remaining: number;
  };

  // User engagement
  engagement: {
    streakCount: number;
    achievementsUnlocked: Achievement[];
    feedbackMessages: string[];
  };
}
```

### Data Model
```typescript
interface OnboardingData {
  profile: {
    name: string;
    role: string;
    avatar: string;
    interests: string[];
  };
  
  connections: {
    known: string[];
    strength: Record<string, number>;
    context: Record<string, string>;
  };
  
  preferences: {
    topics: string[];
    expertise: string[];
    learning: string[];
  };
}
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Profile (1 week)
- Basic information collection
- Avatar upload system
- Progress tracking

### Phase 2: Interest Collection (1 week)
- Dynamic question system
- Interest categorization
- Engagement metrics

### Phase 3: Connection Setup (1 week)
- Connection identification
- Relationship strength mapping
- Initial quiz content generation

## Success Metrics
- Completion rate > 80%
- Average completion time < 5 minutes
- User engagement score > 7/10
- Data quality metrics met
- Sufficient data for quiz generation

## Next Steps
1. Implement profile setup components
2. Create question pool system
3. Build progress tracking
4. Add engagement features
