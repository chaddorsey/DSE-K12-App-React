# Development Process

## Feature Development Lifecycle

1. **Problem Statement & Design**
   - Define requirements
   - Create design document
   - Review and approve approach

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write failing tests
   - Implement feature
   - Get tests passing

3. **Code Quality Verification**
   ```bash
   # Run verification suite
   npm run verify
   ```
   This checks:
   - All tests pass
   - No TypeScript errors
   - No linting issues

4. **Code Review**
   - Submit PR
   - Address feedback
   - Re-run verification
   - Merge when approved

## Continuous Verification

During development, you can run:
```bash
npm run verify:watch
```

This will:
- Watch for file changes
- Run tests automatically
- Check types in real-time
- Report linting issues
- Show errors in terminal
