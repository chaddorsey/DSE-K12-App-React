## Technical Specifications
1. **Architecture**
   ```typescript
   src/
     features/           // Feature-based organization
       quiz/
       onboarding/
       head-to-head/
     shared/            // Shared infrastructure
       network/
       storage/
       testing/
     types/             // Global type definitions
     utils/             // Shared utilities
   ```

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - E2E tests for critical paths
   - Integration tests for features
   - Unit tests for utilities
   - Performance monitoring

3. **State Management**
   - Feature-level state
   - Shared service state
   - Offline state handling
   - Cross-feature coordination

## Implementation Priorities
1. Core infrastructure (2-3 weeks)
2. Quiz system (2 weeks)
