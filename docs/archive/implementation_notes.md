# Implementation Notes
(Collected from previous planning documents)

## Valuable Technical Patterns

### Network Resilience (from network_monitoring.md)
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Connection quality monitoring
- Offline detection with recovery
- Request batching in poor conditions

### Error Handling (from code_audit.md)
- Standardized error types
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic error recovery
- Performance impact tracking

### Form System (from forms_implementation.md)
- Type-safe form state
- Validation integration
- Error message handling
- Loading state management

### Performance Monitoring (from performance_optimization.md)
- Component-level tracking
- Network performance metrics
- Error impact measurement
- User interaction timing

### Mobile Considerations (from phase3_ux_plan.md)
- Touch target sizing: 44px minimum
- Network status prominence
- Offline mode indicators
- Quick task completion flows

### Testing Strategy (from code_audit_fixes.md)
- Component isolation testing
- Network condition simulation
- Error boundary verification
- Mobile interaction testing
