# Project Plan: Refactoring and Optimization Initiative

## Overview
This project will refactor and optimize our existing React/Express codebase to adhere to our Coding Style Guide and Writing Good Interfaces guidelines. The aim is to improve code consistency, modularity, observability, and maintainability, making the project more robust and IDE-friendly for extensive development work.

## Phase 1: Refactoring for Consistency and Modularity
### Objective
Establish a consistent naming convention, split the monolithic code into logically separate modules, and align with the Coding Style Guide.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Audit the codebase to identify inconsistencies (e.g., "Hood" vs. "HeadToHead") and style deviations.
- **Task 2:** Refactor the codebase to split the large monolithic file into separate modules (e.g., separate files for each React component, API utilities, and backend models).
- **Task 3:** Rename variables and functions to adhere to semantic naming and constant usage per the style guide.
### Expected Timeline
1–2 weeks

## Phase 2: Interface and Observability Enhancements
### Objective
Redesign public interfaces (both API and UI) to be intuitive and robust, with improved error handling and logging.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Redesign API interfaces to minimize boilerplate and prevent leakage of implementation details.
- **Task 2:** Refactor React component interfaces to clearly separate presentation from business logic.
- **Task 3:** Integrate structured logging and enhanced error messaging throughout the codebase.
- **Task 4:** Develop unit tests (using Jest/React Testing Library) and integration tests (using Cypress/Postman) for key functionalities.
### Expected Timeline
2 weeks

## Phase 3: IDE Optimization and Production Readiness
### Objective
Optimize the project structure for extensive development in an external IDE and prepare for production deployment.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Finalize the modular folder structure with dedicated directories for components, utilities, models, and tests.
- **Task 2:** Integrate a continuous integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) for automated testing and style checks.
- **Task 3:** Update documentation and conduct final code reviews.
- **Task 4:** Deploy to a staging environment and perform manual QA.
### Expected Timeline
1 week

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Testing
- **Components:**  
  Write unit tests for each React component to validate behavior and state management.
- **API:**  
  Use mocks to simulate API responses and test error handling.
### Integration Testing
- **User Flows:**  
  Automate end-to-end testing for complete user flows (e.g., login → onboarding → match initiation → head-to-head quiz).
- **Tools:**  
  Use Cypress or Postman for integration testing.

## Observability
### Logging
- **Structured Logging:**  
  Implement structured (e.g., JSON) logging to capture key events such as user logins, onboarding completions, match session updates, and errors.
- **Key Points:**  
  Log entry and exit points of major functions, state changes, and API calls.
### Metrics
- **Monitor:**  
  Track API response times, error rates, and head-to-head session metrics using external monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus).

## Future Considerations
### Potential Enhancements
- **Persistent Storage:**  
  Migrate from in‑memory storage to a persistent database.
- **Advanced Modularization:**  
  Further refactor code to leverage modern React patterns (e.g., hooks, context, higher‑order components).
- **Performance Improvements:**  
  Implement caching and lazy loading where appropriate.
### Known Limitations
- The current backend is in‑memory only and intended for development.
- The initial refactoring does not fully split all frontend components; further modularization is planned.

## Dependencies
### Runtime Dependencies
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, qrcode.react.
- **Backend:** Express, bcrypt, cookie-parser, cors, jsonwebtoken.
### Development Dependencies
- ESLint and Prettier for style enforcement.
- Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress for testing.

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication and proper token handling.
- **Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs on both frontend and backend.
- **Best Practices:** Follow secure coding guidelines to prevent injection attacks and data breaches.

## Rollout Strategy
1. **Development Phase:**  
   Work on refactoring in a dedicated branch; conduct regular code reviews.
2. **Testing Phase:**  
   Run unit and integration tests; perform manual QA testing.
3. **Staging Deployment:**  
   Deploy the refactored code to a staging environment and gather user feedback.
4. **Production Deployment:**  
   Merge changes into main and deploy to production.
5. **Monitoring Phase:**  
   Continuously monitor logs and metrics post-deployment and address any issues.
