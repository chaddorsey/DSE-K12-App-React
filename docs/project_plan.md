# Project Plan: Refactoring and Optimization Initiative

## Overview
This project will refactor and optimize our existing React/Express codebase to adhere to our Coding Style Guide and Writing Good Interfaces guidelines, with particular attention to operation in hotel/conference WiFi environments. The aim is to improve code consistency, modularity, observability, and maintainability, while ensuring reliable operation in restricted network environments.

## Phase 1: Network Resilience and Initial Refactoring
### Objective
Implement basic network handling capabilities and begin establishing consistent code structure.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Implement network status monitoring and feedback system
- **Task 2:** Add WiFi portal redirect handling
- **Task 3:** Implement basic retry logic for failed requests
- **Task 4:** Audit codebase for inconsistencies (e.g., "Hood" vs. "HeadToHead")
- **Task 5:** Begin splitting monolithic code into separate modules
### Success Metrics
- Network performance targets met (5s initial load on 3G, 50KB max payload size)
- All portal redirects handled gracefully
- Clear network status feedback implemented
### Expected Timeline
1â€“2 weeks

## Phase 2: Interface and Observability Enhancements
### Objective
Redesign public interfaces for robustness and implement comprehensive logging.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Redesign API interfaces to minimize boilerplate
- **Task 2:** Refactor React component interfaces
- **Task 3:** Integrate structured logging with network event capture
- **Task 4:** Develop comprehensive test suite including network scenarios
### Success Metrics
- 100% of public APIs have TypeScript interfaces
- 100% of React components have PropTypes/TypeScript types
- 80%+ test coverage for business logic
- All network-related errors properly logged
### Expected Timeline
2 weeks

## Phase 3: Code Quality and Production Readiness
### Objective
Finalize code quality improvements and prepare for production deployment.
### Tasks
- **Task 1:** Enforce code quality metrics:
  - Max cyclomatic complexity: 10
  - Max file size: 300 lines
  - Max function size: 30 lines
- **Task 2:** Set up CI pipeline with network testing
- **Task 3:** Complete documentation updates
- **Task 4:** Conduct final QA in simulated conference environment
### Success Metrics
- Zero ESLint/TypeScript errors
- All quality metrics met
- Successful testing in simulated network conditions
### Expected Timeline
1 week

## Testing Strategy
### Unit Testing
- **Components:**  
  Test React components including network status handling
- **API:**  
  Test with simulated network conditions and portal redirects
### Integration Testing
- **User Flows:**  
  Test complete flows with network interruptions
- **Network Scenarios:**  
  Test portal redirects, connection drops, and slow connections

## Observability
### Logging
- **Structured Logging:**  
  JSON format logging for all network events, user actions, and errors
- **Key Points:**  
  Log network status changes, portal interactions, and API failures
### Metrics
- **Monitor:**  
  Track network performance, error rates, and portal redirect handling

## Dependencies
### Runtime Dependencies
- **Frontend:** React, React Router, qrcode.react
- **Backend:** Express, bcrypt, cookie-parser, cors, jsonwebtoken
### Development Dependencies
- ESLint and Prettier for style enforcement
- Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress for testing
- Network condition simulation tools

## Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT handling across network interruptions
- **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs
- **Network Security:** Handle portal redirects securely

## Rollout Strategy
1. **Development:**  
   Implement changes in feature branches with network testing
2. **Testing:**  
   Test in simulated conference network conditions
3. **Staging:**  
   Deploy to staging environment with similar network constraints
4. **Production:**  
   Gradual rollout with network monitoring
5. **Monitoring:**  
   Track network-related metrics and user feedback

## Known Limitations
- Basic network resilience only; no offline functionality
- No complex caching strategies
- In-memory backend storage remains unchanged
